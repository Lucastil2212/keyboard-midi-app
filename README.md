# QuantAudio

QuantAudio is an interactive web application that maps keyboard inputs to MIDI sounds, displays real-time sound wave visualizations, and includes features for recording, playback, and saving recordings to the local filesystem. This project demonstrates how to use the Web Audio API to create engaging audio interactions.

## Features

- **Play Sounds**: Use your keyboard to play sounds mapped to different musical notes.
- **Record & Playback**: Record sequences of notes, play them back, and save them locally as JSON files.
- **Sound Wave Visualization**: View a live waveform display that animates to represent the sounds being played.
- **Adjustable Instruments**: Choose between different waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle).
- **Volume Control**: Easily adjust the volume of the sounds.
- **Promotional Links**: Links to [Manticore Exchange](https://manticore.exchange) and this GitHub repository.
